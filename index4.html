            <p class="y2">Albion Online is a sandbox MMORPG set in an open medieval fantasy world. The game has a player-driven economy, where almost every item is created by someone. You can combine various elements of armor and weapons due to the absence of strict binding to the class system, because you are what you wear. Explore the world, participate in exciting battles with other adventurers, capture territories and build your own house.</p>
